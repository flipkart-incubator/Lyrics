# Lyrics

Lyrics generates Java types from the supplied schema, it does not take a view as to what language the schema is written in (JSON, XML etc), or whether a language is used at all.

We do provide integration with JSON currently in lyrics-json module, for convenience.


Currently we only support invoking Lyrics through your java application but other ways like a command line interface, maven plugin are planned.
